jQuery Inline Field Label Plugin

Description:
The jQuery Inline Field Label Plugin is a simple jQuery plugin to display
HTML label tags within their corresponding input fields. The primary
benefit is that it allows this form of display while maintaining
correct, semantic markup.

Functionality:
Hides label element and moves the text of the label to the value property
of the input element indicated by the "for" attribute of the label. On
focus on the input element, the value is removed. On blur the label text
is restored if the field is left blank. In addition a CSS class is applied
to the field when the label text is present for styling.

Limitations:
Only works on <label> tags associated with <input> tags of type "text" or "password" using the "for" attribute.

Usage:
$(selector).inlineLabel();

Where selector is a jQuery selector indicating a label element with a "for" attribute containing the id of an input element on the page of type "text" or "password".
